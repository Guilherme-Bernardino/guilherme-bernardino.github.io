								multiple obstacles and collectibles along the way. The goal of the game is to reach
								the end of the level without falling or being hit by an obstacle.
								The main mechanic consists of dodging objects through the position of your finger
								on the screen. The character accelerates as a result of touching the screen, and
								then deviates depending on the horizontal position of the finger.</p>
							<p> Contribution: Was responsible for creating logic and interaction between the

                            <p> A hunting game of ghosts in which we control a character with the ability to use a
								vacuum cleaner to capture the ghosts. The game places the player in a scenario, in
								a house or an office, where the objective is to catch as many green
								ghosts in the scene as possible while avoiding the red ghosts. Each level has a certain number of ghosts, and
								these are spread throughout the entire level.
								The main game mechanic is the night vision, through the light of a flashlight
								which points to wherever the player is looking. The control is based on
								joystick and the character can walk in any direction within a 360Âº radius.The flashlight has an amplitude of 30Âº. 
								The light is stopped as soon as it hits an obstacle,
								e.g. the walls of the house, and any ghosts hit by the zone are exposed to the
								player's view. Otherwise, any ghost that is not in the light zone is not visible to the
								player. The player controls the character through the position of the finger on the
								screen in which it moves according to the finger pressed and stops if it is not being
								pressed. There are still complementary mechanics, in the form of a flashing red
								light, which flashes more frequently the closer a red ghost is to the player.</p>
							<p>Contribution: Was responsible for the player control logic, also for creating
								playable levels in Unity, with walls and obstacles. Was
								responsible for inserting 3D models into the scenes, to facilitate work and visual
								understanding of the game.

								middle of an arena against several characters, with the objective of being the last
								survivor left. These arenas contain power-ups that facilitate this objective.
								The main mechanic is that each attack the opponent makes against or receives from
								the player, applies damage to their existing health, and also knockback. This
								mechanic gives the feeling of chaos in the game, in which the knockback applied by
								attacks results in a chaotic fun. The knockback also applies to other opponents if a
								character is pushed against these opponents, which can create a chain of pushes. The
								player controls the character through the position of the finger on the screen, which
								moves according to the pressing of the finger, and stops if it is not being pressed.
								</p>
							<p>Contribution: Responsible for the behavior of opponents in the game. NPCs, which in this game are
								supposed to simulate the behavior of a real player, but are controlled by
								artificial intelligence. The AI is a state-machine that changes states depeding on the condition of the match.</p>

								them from the motorbike. The objective is to reach the end of the race.
								The main mechanics consist of movement and buoyancy. These
								mechanics are what give the game the realistic feeling that you want to achieve in
								a hyper casual game. Jet skis and other objects in the water can float depending on
								the water level, and change the values through waves, the weight of the object
								itself or if physics were applied to the object such as being pushed or landing after
								launching off a ramp. The character drives alone, the player only controls the

								presents a scenario at the beginning, with dirty and broken furniture, walls and

                            <p> A firefighter simunalor, where the player shoots water
								through a hose. It plays as a first-person shooter. 
								The objective of the game is to put out as many fires as possible within the player's sight.
								The main mechanic is shooting water from a hose and interacting with objects in
								the scene. The level starts with a scenario in which there's furniture, people and sometimes animals on fire. 
								The game allows the player to shoot water in the direction
								where the finger is placed, where a jet of water affected by gravity applies physical
								forces and can knock over objects. The main objective is to put out
								fires with this function, fires that are durable and can take a long time to put out. If
								the player is pressing, the hose is turned on, if they let go, it turns off. This process
								uses a finite amount of water, and is spent through a limited tank each time the hose is turned on.</p>
							<p>Contribution: Game Design and made the system that controls the hose. Also responsible for the system of water boundaries
								and the interactions between objects and water.
